# Implement-Route-Planner
Google Maps style routing using A star search algorithm 
â€¢	Programmed a Route Planning Algorithm in Python based on A star search algorithm by creating data structures, setting variables for initialization, start and goal nodes attributes, calculated cost and heuristic functions for each node thus implementing an algorithm for finding best possible path between two locations in the given map.
